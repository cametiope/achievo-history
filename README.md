Achievo
=======
Achievo is a web-based Business Support Services (BSS) application for organizations, built using [the ATK Framework](https://www.github.com/atkphpframework/atk). Achievo was created by [ibuildings.nl](http://www.ibuildings.nl) and development is now carried on by the Achievo community, managed by the [GitHub atkphpframework group](https://www.github.com/atkphpframework/), with the endorsement and permission of [ibuildings.nl](http://www.ibuildings.nl).

This repository is an almost-complete migration of the iBuildings Achievo Subversion (svn) repository (http://svn.ibuildings.nl/achievo).

Repository Structure
